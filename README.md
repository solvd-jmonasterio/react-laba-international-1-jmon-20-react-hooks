# [Homework #20] - React API

This homework was done using Vite with React. Various complex hooks from React such as `useReducer` and `useContext` are featured.

## Scripts

### Running on local

To run it on localhost, first run `yarn` to install dependencies and then you can either run `yarn dev` for the development branch or you can build the app with `yarn build` and preview your production build with `yarn preview`.

## Domain

This is the [Github pages](https://solvd-jmonasterio.github.io/react-laba-international-1-jmon-20-react-hooks/) deployment. I manually copied the files on a new [repo](https://github.com/solvd-jmonasterio/react-laba-international-1-jmon-20-react-hooks/) since I wouldn't know how to script it.
